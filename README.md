weather dashboard to see the weather of multiple cities

This is an application that allows you to search cities within the unites states to find out the current weather as well as the 5 day forecast. this specific assignment was the hardest so far as i struggled a lot with understanding the functions that are used to call APIs and how to access their data. I have learned a little bit more how to access the data within the array and how to utilize those functions but i will definitely need more practice with it. As of right now this applications function is limited to simple searching of city and retrieval of data for that location. that search history is stored in the local storage. however the hotbar on the side is not currently functional as i originally thought it was quick access bars and then when i reread the params i saw that it was search history quick links. i was unable to correct my mistake in time. but i left them for the style and the thought that it was going to be there.
